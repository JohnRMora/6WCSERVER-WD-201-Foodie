# Introduction

The online meal ordering system is one of the most recent services, and it is being used by most fast food businesses in the Western world. Food is ordered online and delivered to the consumer using this manner. The usage of an electronic payment system makes this possible. Customers pay with their credit cards, though they can be served even before they pay with cash or check. As a result, the technology developed for this project will allow clients to purchase food online. Several opportunities are emerging on the internet as a result of the increased awareness of the internet and the technologies linked with it. Because of the internet, a lot of enterprises and companies may now start up with simplicity. An online food ordering system is one such business that the internet has introduced. Many restaurants have chosen to focus on quick preparation and delivery of orders rather than providing a comprehensive dining experience in today's age of fast food and take-out. Until recently, the majority of these delivery orders were placed over the phone, but this technique has numerous drawbacks.
